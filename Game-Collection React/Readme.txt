In this version i've only used basic webdesign tools/langs 
Frontend:
(TypeScript,React ,CSS (Bootstrap),HTML)
Backend:
(Dotnet Core, REST API, MS Local database)


P.S:
Note that it won't run without the node_modules folder, which is too large to be uploaded (Too many files inside). Still this wont be a problem since all the used packages could be found inside the package.json file
